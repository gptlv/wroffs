This application is designed for automating the creation of documents based on data from a CSV file. It reads records and generates documents using DOCX templates.

## Why?

Previously, data was entered manually, which took a lot of time. The document preparation procedure is always the same, and it can be automated.

## Key Features

- Reading records from a `records.csv` file generated by the [gtool](https://github.com/gptlv/gtool) application.
- Generating documents based on pre-set templates located in the `/templates` folder.
- Organizing generated documents into separate directories for each device.

## Main Libraries

- [gocsv](https://github.com/gocarina/gocsv) ‚Äî for parsing CSV files.
- [go-docx](https://github.com/lukasjarosch/go-docx) ‚Äî for working with DOCX documents.
